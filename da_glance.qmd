Analyzing your data is usually about transforming long spreadsheets into a form that is relevant to your question/s, and oftentimes including an appropriate statistical approach for inference.

You might use **descriptive statistics**, which is simply *describing* what you observed without presenting every data point, and instead a summary of those data. This can often be helpful in providing a frame of reference to your dataset before looking deeper at trends and comparisons. Alternatively, sometimes descriptive statistics are the main goal - like in surveys of populations and communities (e.g., what is the population size of a certain grass of interest in an old field?). Descriptive statistics include things like the mean and variance, but can also include more niche measures like dispersion.

You could also use **inferential statistics**, which is more about using math or simulation techniques to *infer* some conclusion form the shape of your data. This is directly relevant to when you have an ecological question about cause and effect, associations among variables, comparisons among categories, etc. The results of inferential statistics provide a starting point from which to interpret/discuss an answer to your question. Examples include t-tests and linear regression.

When using both of these types of statistics, you should be mindful of **data types**, which are the form that variables take. For example, the height of a tree is number, but the species of a tree is a category. This contrast is obvious, but there are subtle differences that can be important for how you describe, assess, and plot your data.
