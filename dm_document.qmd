Taking notes as you conduct research and backing things up are both generally good practice. Here are some things to think about regarding both:

## Document

**What** **to document:**

-   File-specific info or metadata

    -   file naming patterns

    -   variable/attribute definitions

-   Technical steps

    -   data collection

    -   processing (what did you include or exclude?)

    -   analysis steps

-   External data sources

-   Software used with version numbers

-   Meeting notes

-   Organization schemes

**Where to document:**

-   Lab Notebook

    -   Can be physical or digital

    -   Many scientists use pen for this sort of thing

-   Field notebook

    -   Generally easier to be physical if taking notes in the field, can be digital if taking notes at end of day

-   ReadMe file

    -   Good for computer work - data processing and analysis

**When to document:**

-   Set aside \~15 minutes after your work session

-   Develop a regular routine during the research process

    -   Easier to do than remembering everything at the end

-   Can also note things opportunistically as you go

    -   jot potentially relevant observations down in a notebook

    -   comment out code

## Store

**Backing up your data based on medium:**

Paper Data Sheets

-   take a photo or scan each newly filled data sheet after each day of data collection

-   Back up entered data files in cloud storage or some other location

Electronic Data

-   Download a dated copy of all electronically entered files after each day of data collection

    -   You can write an R script to do this for you with Google Sheets

**Problems you may encounter:**

-   Running out of storage space

    -   University accounts usually have plenty, personal not so much...

-   Hard drive failure

    -   Cloud-based storage and alternative physical drives as failsafes

-   Cloud storage providers changing terms

    -   Everything is a service subscription these days...

**Universal Tip:** Use multiple back up formats and physical locations of those back ups.
