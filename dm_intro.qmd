In any scientific research, data management is a highly important skill. As ecologists, we should strive to record, organize, document, and back up our data in such a way that it will be accessible and useful to both our future selves and other future researchers.

In general, the "flow of data" follows the this general pattern:

1.  "Wild" Data - these are our observations, features of the environment we wish to record as...
2.  Recorded Data - this is our first record of our observations, with which we ideally will...
    1.  Back Up - store copies in an alternative medium / location
    2.  Error Check - look over the data for entry errors
    3.  Other Processing - ensure proper filenames, data formats, etc., leading to...
3.  Processed Data - this is the data that we can use to analyze and answer scientific questions!

The following chapters will go into detail about this flow, with tips and various things to consider.
