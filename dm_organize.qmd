As our recorded data moves into electronic form, either directly from our field/lab observations or via data entry from paper data sheets, it is important to consider how we organize and name our electronic files. It may sound boring, but it is valuable to think about!

**Universal Tip:** Be consistent!

## Organize

### File Organization Strategies

-   By Stage - collection materials, raw data, processed data, shared data, etc.

-   By Data Type - text, images, spreadsheets, etc.

-   By Research Activities - experiments, field observations, interviews, etc.

### Organization Tips

-   Move files from "downloads" folder as soon as you can

-   Try not to save important files to your desktop

-   Do not use your folders as the sole description of your files

    -   i.e., use descriptive file names! A file named "plot3" may make sense in your "2023_BioCON" folder, but it will lose context when moved or shared.

## Name

Descriptive file names should be easily scannable and sortable.

Key components include:

-   Project name

-   Date (YYYYMMDD)

-   Type of data

-   Location/site

-   Researcher Info

-   Version

For sorting purposes, it is best to...

-   Use numerical date format (YYYYMMDD)

    -   e.g., 20240710, not 7-10-24

    -   When sorted, everything will be in calendar order, as opposed to December coming before July (12 comes before 7 with an alphabetical sort).

-   Use leading zeroes

    -   e.g., with more than 10 plots, but less than 100, use "01", "02", etc., not "1", "2"

    -   When sorted, plots will be in numeric order, as opposed to plot 11 coming before plot 2 from an alphabetical sort.

**Universal Tips:**

-   Don't use special characters (\*\@,.\^?#!\<\>)

    -   These are incompatible with many file systems

-   Be concise, AKA brief but efficiently informative
