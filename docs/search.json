    "text": "Analyzing your data is usually about transforming long spreadsheets into a form that is relevant to your question/s, and oftentimes including an appropriate statistical approach for inference.\nYou might use descriptive statistics, which is simply describing what you observed without presenting every data point, and instead a summary of those data. This can often be helpful in providing a frame of reference to your dataset before looking deeper at trends and comparisons. Alternatively, sometimes descriptive statistics are the main goal - like in surveys of populations and communities (e.g., what is the population size of a certain grass of interest in an old field?). Descriptive statistics include things like the mean and variance, but can also include more niche measures like dispersion.\nYou could also use inferential statistics, which is more about using math or simulation techniques to infer some conclusion form the shape of your data. This is directly relevant to when you have an ecological question about cause and effect, associations among variables, comparisons among categories, etc. The results of inferential statistics provide a starting point from which to interpret/discuss an answer to your question. Examples include t-tests and linear regression.\nWhen using both of these types of statistics, you should be mindful of data types, which are the form that variables take. For example, the height of a tree is number, but the species of a tree is a category. This contrast is obvious, but there are subtle differences that can be important for how you describe, assess, and plot your data."

    "text": "2.1 Numeric Data\nAny data that can be described with numbers or have quantifiable relationships between values is numeric. But! There are multiple types of numeric data. The most important distinction is discrete vs continuous.\nDiscrete numeric data is data where not every value is possible, but you can still quantify specific differences among the possible values - the major exmaple being integer values (1, 2, 3, the rest). Most programming languages will refer to this type as integer or int. Examples might include number of ants on a log.\nContinuous numeric data is data where every valuable is possible! So this is basically all real numbers, including decimals (1.0, 1.1, etc.). Many programming languages will refer to this as simply numeric data, but lower level languages might use “float” or “double”. Examples might include th biomass of ants on a log. Note: measures that consist of very large integer values are approximately continuous.\nOther things to consider with numeric data is whether the scale of measurement is bound by any values. For example, the number of or biomass of ants on a log cannot be less than zero. In addition, percentages and proportions are bound by 0 and 100 and 0 and 1 respectively. These limitations can lead to special considerations when performing inferential statistics."

But wait! You may be thinking - “isn’t this quantitative?” Well yes and no. The difference between ordinal data and discrete numeric data is that you can’t really quantify the exact difference between ordinal data values. Say there is a go-kart race between Mario, Luigi, and Peach. The place that each finished would be ordinal, e.g., Peach got 1st and Luigi 2nd, but you wouldn’t be able to say how much faster Peach was than Luigi. The time it took for Peach and Luigi each to finish the race would be a numeric variable, and there would be a specific value difference between them."

    "section": "4.1 Classic Frequentist Tests",
    "text": "4.1 Classic Frequentist Tests\nNow let’s go over some statistical tests! For this section, it can be useful to remind ourselves of the variables involved in a research question:\nIndependent / Explanatory / Predictor Variable: this is either what you are manipulating in an experiment or what your study is designed to capture variation in (e.g., C02 at BioCON, species richness at BigBio).\nDependent / Response Variable: these are what you measure or observe throughout your study, generally hypothesizing that they will differ among the levels of your independent variable (e.g., aboveground biomass in BioCON or BigBio).\n\n4.1.1 Assumptions\nWe should mention what these tests generally assume about your data.\nFirst, they assume that your data are independent. This just means that no two observations of your data are more related to eachother in a way that isn’t accounted for by a variable. Say you were comparing mean tree height between two forests - individual tree heights in the same forest would be independent, but two measures of the same tree on different days would be non-independent.\nSecond, they assume that the errors are normally distributed. This is a bit more confusing without a statistical background. An example may be illustrative - in the tree height example above, we assume that the individual tree height are normally distributed about the mean. Without getting too much into the weeds, if you collect enough data (i.e., 30+ observations), these errors will likely be approximately normally distributed. However, things get divcey when we deal with data that is not continuous like tree height, for example, discrete count data - more on that below.\nThird, they assume homogeneity of variance. This is another complicated one, but it mean that the variance of the errors doesn’t change with the independent variable. In the tree example, we are assuming that the variance of the differences between observed tree heights and the forest mean does not change between forests.\nData that break the first assumption are difficult to deal with outside of accounting for the non-independence factor (which can severely reduce the size of your sample), but failing to meet the second or third assumptions generally leads to transforming data or using alternative tests.\n\n\n4.1.2 Categorical Predictor/s, Numeric Response\n\n4.1.2.1 Two Predictor Categories\nWhen you are comparing numeric values from two groups, you can use a t-test to compare their means. T-tests can be paired when each observation in one group is specifically linked to an observation in the other group (e.g., masses of sibling plants in separate treatments) which can be more powerful. When the variance of values in each group changes, you can do a t-test with unequal variance.\nThe effect size here is the difference between means.\n\n\n4.1.2.2 More Than Two Predictor Categories\nIf you have more than two groups/categories, you can use a Analysis of Variance or ANOVA. This will tell you if the means of each group are equivalent, or if there is at least one inequality. You can test for pairwise comparisons among the groups with Tukey’ test. If you have multiple categorical predictors, you can do two-way or three-way ANOVAs. Tests with more than three categorical predictor variables are uncommon and harder to interpret.\nThe effect sizes are the pairwise difference in means.\n\n\n4.1.2.3 Ordinal Predictors\nWhen your predictor variable is ordinal, the quick and easy way to analyze it would be to convert the predictor to a numeric integer data type and proceed from there. However this is imprecise…\nThis section is under construction\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Numeric Predictor/s, Numeric Response\n\n4.1.3.1 Simple Association\nWhen all you are interested in is whether two numeric variables are related to one another, not cause and effect, you can do a correlation test. Pearson’s correlation is generally applicable for continuous data. Spearman’s correlation is good for when you are dealing with data with non-normal distributions, like count data (it also works for ordinal data!).\nThe effect size here will be a correlation coefficient ranging from -1 to 1, with -1 means an inverse relationship, 0 means no relationship, and 1 mean a direct positive relationship.\nCause and Effect\nWhen you are suppose a causal relationship between numeric variables, you can use a linear regression. This will use linear algebra or maximum likelihod estimation (don’t worry about it) to find the best fit line that describes the relationship between two variables; where the sum of the squared distances from the observations to the line is minimized. You can also include multiple predictor variables to perform multiple linear regression AKA multivariate linear regression.\nWhen your response variable is count data, the assumptions of simple linear regression are usually unmet, so you can use generalized forms like a Poisson regression or a Negative Binomial Regression.\nThe effect sizes here are the parameter coefficients, i.e., how much does the response change for on unit increase in the predictor? Note: these are not straightforward for Poisson and negative binomial regression, so ask your mentor.\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Numeric Predictor/s, Categorical Response\n\n4.1.4.1 Binary Response\nWhen your categorical response is only two categories (e.g., presence or absence), you can use a binomial regression AKA logistic regression. This works similarly to linear regression, but the effect sizes are measured in log odds, which is difficult to interpret, but can be transformed to estimating how the probability of one category value over the other increases with a variable.\n\n\n4.1.4.2 Multiple Response Categories\nMultinomial regression (under construction)\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Categorical Predictor/s, Categorical Response\nChi-square test (under construction)"

    "text": "4.2 Bootstrapping\nOne alternative to these classic tests has no assumptions: bootstrapping. Essentially, it involves using the sampled data to simulate more samples, and compare your observations to those simulations.\nEmpirical Bootstrapping is where you take your actual observations and shuffle which value is associated with which observation. For example, you could take measurements of tree heights from two forests, and randomly assign forest ID to each measurement.\nParametric Bootstrapping is where you summarize your observed data and use it to generat simulated data. For example, you could calculate the mean and variance of tree heights in two forests and then generate simulated forests of trees through random pulls from a normal distribution with the appropriate mean and variance.\nWith both approaches, you simulate a large number of simulated datasets (1000+), and then calculate whatever you are interested in for each of those simulations, and compare the calculation from the observed data to the distribution of simulated values. For example, if you empirically bootstrap the two forests of tree heights 1000 times, and then calculate difference in means for each you will have 1000 mean difference values. The proportion of those simulated values that are equal to or more extreme than your observed mean difference is your p-value!"

In fact, the different types of values R can deal with are called data types as well!\nIn R, values can be numeric, character, or logical (among other, more specific types).\n\n## numeric values are numbers!\n2\n\n[1] 2\n\n2.5\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n## character values are letters, words, phrases (often referred to as \"strings)\n\"a\"\n\n[1] \"a\"\n\n\"apple\"\n\n[1] \"apple\"\n\n\"there is a worm in my apple\"\n\n[1] \"there is a worm in my apple\"\n\n## note: character values or strings must be surrounded by \"\" or '' for R to interpret them as strings\n\n## Logical values are TRUE or FALSE (you've seen these above)\nTRUE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nFALSE\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThere are other types of values too: missing values (NA and NaN), infinite values (Inf and -Inf), and something that indicates empty (NULL).\n\n\n8.5.2 Variables\nVariables are named values that are stored in the “environment”, or the workspace that R can access to perform its tasks. In order to store a value as a variable, you need to use a special kind of operator called an assignment operator (&lt;- or =). As I mentioned variables have names, which are unquoted text.\n\n## store 2 as a variable called x\nx &lt;- 2\n\n## R returns no output here because you're just storing a value\n## but you can return the value by calling the variable\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n## store 3 as a variable called y\ny &lt;- 3\n\n## you use variables with operators\nx + y\n\n[1] 5\n\n## store a character value\nstring &lt;- \"hello\"\n\n## math doesn't work on strings\n\nTechnically, you can use = in place of &lt;-. This is why the equals operator is ==. I generally use &lt;- to prevent any confusion between assignment and comparison.\n\n8.5.2.1 Naming Rules\nVariables have rules about how they can be named:\n\nNo special symbols other than _ and .\nYou can’t start with a number or _.\nThey can’t be special words that R interprets differently. You can enter ?Reserved in your console to see a list.\n\n\n\n\n8.5.3 Data Structures\nData structures are collections of values with some sort of organization, and also saved in the environment. Plot twist: the variables above are a the simplest data structure, the scalar, which is just a single value.\nThe next data structure is the vector, which is a collection of values of the same data type. We can store them much like variables.\n\n## we use another operator, :, to create a sequence of integers from 1 to 10\nmy_vector &lt;- 1:5\n\nmy_vector\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n## you can also create vectors with the combine function, c()\nmy_other_vector &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nmy_other_vector\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n\nThe next data structure is called a list. A list is a collection of values like a vector, but they can be of any data type, or data structure. You can have a list of numeric values and character values, a list of vectors, or even a lists of lists! Every other complex data structure is technically a list with special attributes and/or rules.\n\n## you can create lists with the list function\nmy_list &lt;- list(\"a\", 1, 2:4)\n\nmy_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"a\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 2 3 4\n\n## can also use the combine function, but it will default to a vector when data types are the same\nmy_other_list &lt;- c(\"b\", 2)\n\nFinally, the most common special type of list you will use is the data frame. A data frame is a list of vectors that are arranged in a table, much like an excel spreadsheet. Each of the vectors will be named as a column, and all must be the same length. The position of a value in a vector is its row in the data frame.\n\n## we can make a data frame with the data.frame function\nmy_data &lt;- data.frame(letter = c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"), # each column has a name\n                      number = c(1, 2, 3),\n                      vowel = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))\n\nmy_data\n\n  letter number vowel\n1      a      1  TRUE\n2      b      2 FALSE\n3      c      3 FALSE\n\n\nNext, we will extend these concepts a bit further!"

    "text": "9.1 Packages\nPackages are collections of R functions that people write to make tasks easier. One of the strengths of R is that countless programmers have taken the time to assemble functions of use in their respective fields, and shared them with the world. For example the “vegan” package contains a number of functions geared towards community ecology, like calculating diversity indices. You could calculate a diversity index with just the base R, but it would be more difficult and take longer.\nYou can install packages in at least two ways:\n\nYou can use the following code, with the package names in quotes (this is one of the few times where using the console is recommended, because you only need to install a package once):\n\ninstall.packages(\"PACKAGE NAME HERE\")\n\nOr you can use the packages tab in RStudio. In the lower right panel, there should be a packages tab in between “Plots” and “Help”. Once there, there is an “Install” button. When clicked a window will appear allowing you to search for packages to install.\n\nBut Installing packages does not make them automatically accessible to you. When R boots up, it only loads its base functionality by default, so you have to load any packages that you want to use for a given R session. You can do this with the following code (with the package name not in quotes):\n\nlibrary(PACKAGE NAME)\n\nThe code for loading packages should be saved in your r script, because it will need to be done every time you open R.\nThere is a family of packages that is very popular called the “tidyverse.” The aim of the tidyverse is to make data manipulation and visualization streamlined and efficient. Some people are very opinionated about whether you should use the tidyverse or base R, but in my opinion, it’s mostly silliness. If you only want to dip into R and don’t plan to use it much in the future, you may as well just pick up the specific functions you need to use and not worry about much else. If you’d like to continually use R for data analysis, but don’t plan on getting deep into it, getting a handle on the tidyverse may be a good idea. If you want to really get into R, I would recommend learning how to do things in base R (as well as tidyverse functions).\nYou can install the tidyverse suite with:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")"

    "title": "9  Next Steps",
    "section": "9.2 Subsetting",
    "text": "9.2 Subsetting\nIn the last section we introduced data structures. Now let’s talk about what you can do with them.\n\n9.2.1 Vectors\nThe individual elements of a vector can be accessed with bracket operators - [ and ]. You can refer to an element by its index, or its numeric place in the sequence of elements (e.g., the 1st, the 10th, etc.). It’s important to not here that R starts counting at 1, while many other programming language start counting at 0 (e.g., Python). This is another thing that people are opinionated about, and if you put your mind to it, you can be too! Anyway, here are some examples:\n\n## let's create a vector of the first five letters of the alphabet\nmy_vector &lt;- c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"e\")\nmy_vector\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\"\n\n## now let's return the 5th element\nmy_vector[5]\n\n[1] \"e\"\n\n## we can return multiple elements with c()\nmy_vector[c(2,4)]\n\n[1] \"b\" \"d\"\n\n## or as a series with :\nmy_vector[2:4]\n\n[1] \"b\" \"c\" \"d\"\n\n\nYou can also use negative numbers to exclude values from what’s returned:\n\n## lose the last element\nmy_vector[-5]\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\"\n\n## everything but the last element\nmy_vector[-1:-4]\n\n[1] \"e\"\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Lists\nSubsetting vectors is fairly straightforward, but subsetting lists can be tricky. Since lists have multiple levels of organization, they use both the [] operators and the [[]] operators. Single brackets give you the list element, and double brackets give you what the list element contains. Let’s demonstrate:\n\n## create a list \nmy_list &lt;- list(c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"), \"d\", \"e\")\nmy_list\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"d\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"e\"\n\n## grab the first list element\nmy_list[1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n## grab what's conatined in the first list element (in this case a vector)\nmy_list[[1]]\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n## another example with a scalar\nmy_list[2]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"d\"\n\nmy_list[[2]]\n\n[1] \"d\"\n\n## you can also subset what you have subsetted:\nmy_list[[1]][1]\n\n[1] \"a\"\n\n## but if you try subsetting a list element, it won't work the same way\nmy_list[1][1]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n## this is because [] returns the list element as a list of length 1, therefore [1] gives you the same thing again, and [2] would give you a NULL list.\n\nThis distinction can be difficult to understand, but don’t worry! It takes time. The best analogy I’ve seen is from Hadley Wickham here:\nhttps://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html#subset-single\nYou can think of a list as a train, every list element is a train car, and each has its own contents. Single brackets give you the train car/s, and double brackets gives you what’s inside a single train car. And even a single train car is a train (or a list). Also note:\n\n## you can grab multiple list elements with []; this give a list with two elements\nmy_list[1:2]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"d\"\n\n## list elements can be named and indexed by their name as well\nnamed_list &lt;- list(first = 1:3, second = 10)\nnamed_list\n\n$first\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n$second\n[1] 10\n\nnamed_list[\"first\"]\n\n$first\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Data Frames\nSubsetting data frames is a little easier to get a handle on, you just need to think in two dimensions. When using single brackets to subset data frames, you need to specify the index of the row and the column separately and in that order. You separate each index number by a comma inside the brackets. Check it out:\n\n## create data frame\nmy_data &lt;- data.frame(letter = c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"), # each column has a name\n                      number = c(1, 2, 3),\n                      vowel = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))\nmy_data\n\n  letter number vowel\n1      a      1  TRUE\n2      b      2 FALSE\n3      c      3 FALSE\n\n## grab the element in the 2nd row, 1st column\nmy_data[2,1]\n\n[1] \"b\"\n\n## you can also grab a whole row or column by leaving onse side of the comma blank\nmy_data[2,]\n\n  letter number vowel\n2      b      2 FALSE\n\nmy_data[,1]\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n## (subsetting a row gives you a data frame, subsetting a column gives you a vector)\n\nBut data frames also have named columns! Let’s use that to our advantage. You can specify a column’s name instead of its index in brackets, like for a list, or you can use the $ operator.\n\n## subsetting by name in brackets\nmy_data[,\"vowel\"]\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n## subsetting by name with $ (notice no quotes)\nmy_data$vowel\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n## the downside of $ is that you can't grab more than one column like with brackets\nmy_data[,c(\"letter\", \"vowel\")]\n\n  letter vowel\n1      a  TRUE\n2      b FALSE\n3      c FALSE\n\n## subsetting multiple columns gives you a data.frame\n\n## you can use $ with named lists too\nnamed_list$first\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n## you can mix subsetting operators if you ever need to\nmy_data$vowel[1]\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nmy_data[1,]$vowel\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nYou can also use brackets to select rows by value, not index. You just need to use some comparison operator in a statement that resolves as TRUE or FALSE.\n\n## grab the consonant rows\nmy_data[my_data$vowel == FALSE,]\n\n  letter number vowel\n2      b      2 FALSE\n3      c      3 FALSE\n\n## grab the rows before the third\nmy_data[my_data$number &lt; 3,]\n\n  letter number vowel\n1      a      1  TRUE\n2      b      2 FALSE\n\n## you can combine criteria\nmy_data[my_data$number &lt; 3 & my_data$vowel == FALSE,]\n\n  letter number vowel\n2      b      2 FALSE\n\n\nNow the reason that we talked about packages in between data structures and subsetting is because the tidyverse (specifically, the dplyr package) has more functions for subsetting: filter and select. Filter works much like grabbing rows by value, and select works like grabbing columns by name. Let’s look at some examples:\n\n## load the tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.1     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n## filter for consonants\nfilter(.data = my_data, vowel == FALSE)\n\n  letter number vowel\n1      b      2 FALSE\n2      c      3 FALSE\n\n## select letter related columns\nselect(.data = my_data, letter, vowel)\n\n  letter vowel\n1      a  TRUE\n2      b FALSE\n3      c FALSE\n\n## you can also exclude columns\nselect(.data = my_data, !number)\n\n  letter vowel\n1      a  TRUE\n2      b FALSE\n3      c FALSE\n\n## note: selecting a single column will give a data frame, not a vector\nselect(.data = my_data, number)\n\n  number\n1      1\n2      2\n3      3\n\n## another tidyverse/dplyr function, pull, will give just a vector\npull(.data = my_data, number)\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nAs you can see, filter, select and pull are versatile, consistent and powerful. However, they lack one key ability: assignment. You can use brackets and $s to assign things:\n\n## assign a new value to a data element (NA means missing value)\nmy_data[3,2] &lt;- NA\nmy_data\n\n  letter number vowel\n1      a      1  TRUE\n2      b      2 FALSE\n3      c     NA FALSE\n\n## create a whole new column with $ (vector must be of same length as the number of rows)\nmy_data$new_column &lt;- c(\"some\", \"new\", \"data\")\nmy_data\n\n  letter number vowel new_column\n1      a      1  TRUE       some\n2      b      2 FALSE        new\n3      c     NA FALSE       data"

    "section": "10.1 Reading Data",
    "text": "10.1 Reading Data\nImporting data into R is often referred to as reading data, as that is what the computer is doing, it’s reading the contents of a file (usually a text file). Most ecologists and data scientists work with a text file called a Comma Separated Value file, or csv. This is a small file that’s easy for computers to read where each column is separated by a column, and each row by a new line. You can save excel files as csv from the “Save As…” menu, and you can specify csv as the type when downloading a Google sheet.\n\n10.1.1 From Your Computer\nSo when you have files you want to read locally on your computer, the first thing you need to think about is what’s called the “working directory”. The working directory is the folder on your computer where R will look for files when prompted, and also where it will save output.\nYou can check your current working directory:\n\n## return current working directory\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/kit/Documents/UMN/Research/cedar_creek_projects/ccesr_intern_hub\"\n\n\nYou can also set your working directory manually\n\n## change working directory\nsetwd(\"some/different/folder\")\n\nOr, in RStudio, you can click the Session dropdown menu at the top of the window, then “Set Working Directory”, then “Choose Directory.”\nIf you use an R Project (highly recommended), you don’t have to worry as much about this. If you have a project open, the working directory will be automatically set to the folder that contains the .Rproj file that is created when you create a project. See Section 6.2 for more info!\nWhen you’re in an R Project, or have a csv you want in your working directory, you can read it into your environment like so:\n\n## read data\nmy_data &lt;- read.csv(\"the name of your file in quotes\", header = TRUE)\n\nThe read.csv function creates a data frame from the csv you specify, and then the &lt;- assigns it to “my_data.” The “header = TRUE” argument tells R to interpret the first line of the csv as the column names.\n\n\n10.1.2 tidyverse Function\nThe readr package in the tidyverse family also has its own data reading functions.\n\n## load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n## read data (assumes header by default)\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"name of your data in quotes\")\n\nThese functions are pretty similar, with one exception: read.csv gives you a data frame, but read_csv gives you a “tibble.” What is a tibble? It’s another special type of list, much like a data frame, but with a few differences. IT was designed to work more consistently with tidyverse functions. One important difference between data frames and tibbles that when you subset an individual column with the brackets ([]), data frames will give you vectors, and tibble will give single column tibbles. This has caused me confusion when writing functions, but you may not run into it.\n\n\n10.1.3 From The Web\nYou can also read files directly from the web. If you have your data in Google sheets, you can create a URL for R to import it directly. Simply go to the File menu, click “Share” and then “Publish to web”. In the box that pops up, you will need to select the file type as “.csv”, not web page. Then save the URL that it gives you!\nFor demonstration, I’ve created a few data sheets that you too can import into R by copying the following code:\n\n## put the url of the data in quotes\nfake_mammals &lt;- read.csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ9mfx88nM33PC6WpIh3nSxMvkM98nEszw5gpUq7KdqbiCskF8Pqvrl0W2EqNf9rD1JEepb-hSMIb_j/pub?output=csv\", header = TRUE)\n\nfake_insects &lt;- read.csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT0snHMdsxzzzkxt_JVRFooJDB60lGSJQlrjUU29tGYOhIpqvx_pzja3Eqr9l5b4f76yMFvkiGzuK1Z/pub?output=csv\")\n\nThese two files will be used throughout the next chapters. The first is some made-up data of some mammal captures at 6 sites across forest and savanna habitats (with mass and parasite info), and the second is made up sweep-netting data from the same sites.\n\n\n10.1.4 Other File Types\nUnder construction…."

Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  17.00   20.75   23.00   22.60   25.00   28.00 \n\n## summarize helminth masses\nsummary(fake_mammals$helminth_mass_mg)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

Any categorical variable will be considered a character type generally. But the way character types are stored in computer memory does not lend itself well to statistical analysis. To remedy this, R has a special data type called the factor for categorical data. A factor is made up of two parts - the levels, which are stored to the computer as integers, and the labels, which are character strings that we can read as the category names.\nIn our mammal data, we probably want mammal species, site type, and site all to be factors. We can convert them with the as.factor function!\n\n## convert species to factor\nfake_mammals$species &lt;- as.factor(fake_mammals$species)\n## convert site type to factor\nfake_mammals$site_type &lt;- as.factor(fake_mammals$site_type)\n## convert site to a factor\nfake_mammals$site &lt;- as.factor(fake_mammals$site)\n\n## check it out!\nsummary(fake_mammals$species)\n\n        Deer mouse        Meadow vole White-footed mouse \n                15                  9                 24 \n\n## also do for insects\nfake_insects$site &lt;- as.factor(fake_insects$site)\nfake_insects$site_type &lt;- as.factor(fake_insects$site_type)\n\nThere are also similar functions for converting data types to numeric (as.numeric()) and character (as.character())."

You can assign something to a new column with the $ and &lt;- operators.\nFor the insect data, let’s say we wanted to calculate average temperature at a given site based on the recorded high (temp_hi) and low (temp_low):\n\n## calculate mean temp\nfake_insects$temp_mean &lt;- (fake_insects$temp_hi + fake_insects$temp_lo)/2\n\n## check it out\nfake_insects$temp_mean\n\n[1] 21.25 23.25 19.25 26.75 24.00 28.00\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 tidyverse\nIn the tidyverse, adding new columns is done with the mutate function:\n\n## load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.1     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n## mutate a new column\nfake_insects &lt;- mutate(.data = fake_insects, ## specify data\n                       temp_mean_mutated = (temp_hi + temp_lo)/2) ## calculate new column\n\n## this column should be the same for all six rows (a TRUE should be returned for each)\nfake_insects$temp_mean == fake_insects$temp_mean_mutated\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\nAs you can see, using mutate mean you have to write the name of data frame fewer times."

    "text": "11.2 Pivoting / Reshaping\nYou also may need to transform your data between the wide and long formats (recall the data management slides, which will be added to this book eventually). I find that the pivot functions from tidyr in the tidyverse are easier to use, so we will go over those. But by all means, if you prefer base, go for it! I’m just less familiar with using base R for this.\n\n11.2.1 Wide to Long\nThe insect data is partly in wide format: we have a column for each order of insect, where the count is implicitly the values in the cells. IT will be easier to work with if we make one “count” column and one “order” column. We can do this with the pivot_longer function:\n\n## lengthen the order count data\nlong_insects &lt;- pivot_longer(data = fake_insects, \n                             cols = c(hymenoptera, lepidoptera, coleoptera, diptera, \n                                      odonata, hemiptera, orthoptera, ephemeroptera, \n                                      tricoptera, plecoptera),\n                             names_to = \"order\",\n                             values_to = \"count\"\n                             )\n\n## check it out\nhead(long_insects)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  site  site_type temp_hi temp_lo temp_mean temp_mean_mutated order       count\n  &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 a     forest       23.5      19      21.2              21.2 hymenoptera     9\n2 a     forest       23.5      19      21.2              21.2 lepidoptera     3\n3 a     forest       23.5      19      21.2              21.2 coleoptera     16\n4 a     forest       23.5      19      21.2              21.2 diptera        29\n5 a     forest       23.5      19      21.2              21.2 odonata         4\n6 a     forest       23.5      19      21.2              21.2 hemiptera      10\n\n\nNow we have multiple rows for each site, one for each order! You may not believe me, but this will make things easier down the line.\nFor reference, the cols argument specifies which columns you want to pivot. The names_to argument names the column that will contain the pivoted column names, and the values_to argument names the column that the cell values will be placed.\n\n\n11.2.2 Long to Wide\nYou’ll occasionally want to turn long to wide as well. pivot_wider works for this\n\n## widen our long data\nwide_insects &lt;- pivot_wider(data = long_insects,\n                            names_from = \"order\",\n                            values_from = \"count\")\n\nThis is the inverse of what we just did - we made a column for each value in the column given to the names_from argument, the values of which are pulled from the column given to the values_from argument.\n\n\n11.2.3 Base\nYou can pivot data in base R with reshape, but this section is under construction…"

    "section": "12.1 Describing With Summaries",
    "text": "12.1 Describing With Summaries\nYou’ll often want to give simple, illustrative information about the data you collected. The tidyverse is great for this!\n\n12.1.1 tidyverse\nThe package dplyr in the tidyverse has two wonderful functions: group_by() and summarize(). You can also use the British spelling, “summarise()”, but I use a z because it’s what the founders would have wanted.\nBefore we use these however, we need to introduce a very useful operator, the pipe: %&gt;%. This operator directs data into the first argument of a function, which allows you to chain functions together efficiently. Let’s try an example with the filter and select subsetting functions (see Section 9.2.3):\n\n## grab only the forest sites from the insect data\nforest_sites &lt;- fake_insects %&gt;% ## take fake_insects and pipe it into filter...\n  filter(site_type == \"forest\") %&gt;% ## filter only forest rows, pipe into select\n  select(site) ## select only the site column\n## the whole pipe chain is assigned to \"forest_sites\"\n\nforest_sites\n\n  site\n1    a\n2    b\n3    c\n\n## this is the same as\nforest_rows &lt;- filter(fake_insects, site_type == \"forest\")\nforest_sites &lt;- select(forest_rows, site)\n\nNow, let’s try with group_by() and summarize()! Let’s say you wanted the total number of insects caught at each site (be sure to have pivoted your insect data in the last chapter!):\n\n## summarize total insect catch\ninsect_counts &lt;- long_insects %&gt;%\n  group_by(site) %&gt;% ## group observations\n  summarize(total_insects = sum(count)) ## sum all insects\n\ninsect_counts\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  site  total_insects\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 011              51\n2 a                84\n3 b                87\n4 c               136\n5 d                60\n6 e                61\n\n\nAs you can see, the summarize function works a bit like the mutate function: you\nNote that group_by doesn’t visibly change your data, but it changes some attributes that the computer can see when it runs the summarize function. If you forgot which sites are in which type of habitat, you could also include that variable in the group_by arguments (since it doesn’t subdivide the sites, it won’t change the calculation).\n\ninsect_counts &lt;- long_insects %&gt;%\n  group_by(site, site_type) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_insects = sum(count))\n\nYou can also calculate means and variances! You can use the mean, var, and sd functions. Let’s try for each order across all sites:\n\norder_summary &lt;- long_insects %&gt;%\n  group_by(order) %&gt;%\n  summarize(count_mean = mean(count), ## you can do multiple sumaries at once\n            count_var = var(count),\n            count_sd = sd(count))\n\nhead(order_summary)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  order         count_mean count_var count_sd\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 coleoptera         15.8      43.4      6.59\n2 diptera            17       163.      12.8 \n3 ephemeroptera       5.33    171.      13.1 \n4 hemiptera           6.17     42.6      6.52\n5 hymenoptera         8.5       9.1      3.02\n6 lepidoptera         5.67      5.87     2.42\n\n\nYou could also do this separately by site type:\n\norders_by_habitat &lt;- long_insects %&gt;%\n  group_by(site_type, order) %&gt;%\n  summarize(count_mean = mean(count), ## you can do multiple sumaries at once\n            count_var = var(count),\n            count_sd = sd(count))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'site_type'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\nhead(orders_by_habitat)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n# Groups:   site_type [1]\n  site_type order         count_mean count_var count_sd\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 forest    coleoptera         20.7      17.3      4.16\n2 forest    diptera            28.3       9.33     3.06\n3 forest    ephemeroptera      10.7     341.      18.5 \n4 forest    hemiptera          11.7      14.3      3.79\n5 forest    hymenoptera        10.3       2.33     1.53\n6 forest    lepidoptera         4.33      2.33     1.53\n\n\nFinally, you can save summarized output with write.csv() or write_csv():\n\n## save summary to your working/project directory\n## first argument is data, second argument is filename\nwrite.csv(orders_by_habitat, \"summary of orders\")\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Base\naggregate function (under construction…)\n\n\n12.1.3 Making Nice Tables\nthe gt package is good for this (under construction….)"
