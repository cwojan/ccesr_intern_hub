# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This website / HTML book is intended to collect resources for Cedar Creek summer interns doing independent research projects, and present those resources in an easily accessible way.

For now, the focus is primarily on data management, analysis, and using the R programming language.

Much of the content featured is adapted from the work of past CCESR Fellows, including Maggie Anderson, Mariana CÃ¡rdenas, and Bea Baselga Cervera. The primary author of the site is Chris Wojan, with Qianna Xu providing the sections on community ecology measures.

This site is structured in different parts, which can be read in any order you choose, depending on your needs / what you already know. Currently, the first part describes data management practices, the second part goes over data analysis in general, the third part describes R-related software and workflows, and the fourth part is intended to give a primer in R coding.
